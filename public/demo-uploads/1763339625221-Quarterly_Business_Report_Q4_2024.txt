Risk Factors
The following risk factors were identified in Q4 2024:

as currently proposed. Mitigation: Active engagement with regulatory bodies and industry advocacy
groups.

2. SUPPLY CHAIN RISK: Solar panel component costs increased 12% due to global semiconductor
shortage. Impact: Margin pressure on new installations. Mitigation: Secured 6-month forward contracts
with key suppliers.

attempted breach detected and blocked in November. Mitigation: Enhanced security protocols,
employee training, and cyber insurance coverage increased to $5M.

Market share impact minimal so far (0.3%). Mitigation: Enhanced value proposition focusing on
